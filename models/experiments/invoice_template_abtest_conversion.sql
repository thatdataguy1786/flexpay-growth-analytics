-- üß™ A/B Test Analysis: Invoice Template Conversion Rate (FlexPay)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------
-- Goal:
## üìÑ A/B Test ‚Äì Conversion Rate by Invoice Template

**Objective**:  
Evaluate whether Template B led to a higher conversion rate (i.e. invoices getting paid) compared to Template A.

**Metric Tracked**:  
- Invoice-to-payment conversion rate  
  (i.e. What % of invoices were paid for each template)

**Statistical Test Used**:  
‚úÖ 2-Proportion Z-Test  
(`statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportions_ztest` in Python)

**Results**:
- Template classic Paid: 324 / 506
- Template modern Paid: 319 / 512
- P-Value: 0.5679 ‚Üí ‚ùå Not statistically significant

**Interpretation**:  
There is no statistically significant difference in paid conversion between the two templates. We **cannot conclude** Template B improves payment likelihood.

**Recommendation**:  
- Gather more data or test additional variants
- Consider evaluating other metrics (e.g. time to payment, satisfaction)

-- ðŸ§ª A/B Test Analysis: Invoice Template Conversion Rate (FlexPay)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------
-- Goal:
-- Evaluate whether Template B results in a higher invoice-to-payment conversion rate than Template A.

-- Metric:
-- Conversion Rate = (# Paid Invoices) / (Total Invoices Sent)
-- Grouped by: invoice_template ('Template A' vs 'Template B')

-- Tables Used:
-- - invoices: invoice_id, user_id, invoice_template, sent_date
-- - payments: invoice_id, payment_date

-- Logic:
-- 1. Filter to invoices using 'Template A' or 'Template B'
-- 2. Join with payments table to identify paid invoices
-- 3. Label each invoice as paid (1) or unpaid (0)
-- 4. Aggregate by template: total invoices, paid invoices, conversion rate

-- Note:
-- You can export the output of this query and calculate Z-test p-value using Excel or Python (scipy.stats.proportions_ztest)
-- Optionally, calculate 95% Confidence Intervals in SQL if needed for visualization or dashboarding.

-- ðŸ“Š Weekly Cohort Retention Analysis for FlexPay
-- ----------------------------------------------
-- Goal:
-- Measure 30-day user retention using behavioral signals.
-- Day 0 = First sent invoice date (sent_date).
-- Retention = User sends another invoice within a specific weekly bucket after Day 0.
--
-- Why sent_date?
-- - It captures true product engagement (user actively using the product)
-- - Unlike issue_date (intent-only) or paid_date (client-dependent), sent_date reflects execution.
--
-- Retention Bands:
-- - Day 1â€“7
-- - Day 8â€“14
-- - Day 15â€“21
-- - Day 22â€“30
--
-- Output includes:
-- - Weekly cohort start date
-- - Users in each cohort
-- - Count of users retained per band
-- - % of users retained per band (rounded to 1 decimal)
--
-- Analyst Notes:
-- This model can feed dashboards or be used to compare cohorts pre/post product feature changes.
-- Could be extended for Day 60/90, product segmentation, or experiment group filtering.
